	abstract = "Recognition of human communication has previously focused on deliberately acted emotions or in structured or artificial social contexts. This makes the result hard to apply to realistic social situations. This paper describes the recording of spontaneous human communication in a specific and common social situation: conversation between two people. The clips are then annotated by multiple observers to reduce individual variations in interpretation of social signals. Temporal and static features are generated from tracking using heuristic and algorithmic methods. Optimal features for classifying examples of spontaneous communication signals are then extracted by AdaBoost. The performance of the boosted classifier is comparable to human performance for some communication signals, even on this challenging and realistic data set.",
